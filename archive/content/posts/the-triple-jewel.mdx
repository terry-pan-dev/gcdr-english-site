## THE TRIPLE JEWEL

The Buddha knew it would be difficult for people to follow his teachings on their own, so he established the Three Refuges for them to rely on. If a person wants to become Buddhists take refuge in and rely on the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. These are known as the Triple Jewel. The Sangha are the monks and nuns. They live in monasteries and carry on the Buddha's teaching. The word Sangha means 'harmonious community'. The Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha together possess qualities that are precious like jewels and can lead one to enlightenment.

A refuge is a place to go for safety and protection, like a shelter in a storm. Taking refuge does not mean running away from life. It means living life in a fuller, truer way.

Taking refuge is also like a man traveling for the first time to a distant city. He will need a guide to show him which path to follow and some traveling companions to help him along the way.

- **The Buddha is the guide.**
- **The Dharma is the path.**
- **The Sangha are the teachers or companions along the way.**

There is a special ceremony for taking refuge with the Triple Jewel. With a sincere mind, one recites the following verse in front of an ordained monk or nun:

- I go to the Buddha for refuge.
- I go to the Dharma for refuge.
- I go to the Sangha for refuge.

<Callout type="insight">
  For a Buddhist, taking refuge is the first step on the path to enlightenment. Even if
  enlightenment is not achieved in this life, one has a better chance to become enlightened in a
  future life. One who take the precepts is called a lay person.

The Triple Jewel provides the foundation for Buddhist practice. By taking refuge in the Buddha, we acknowledge the possibility of enlightenment. By taking refuge in the Dharma, we commit to following the teachings. By taking refuge in the Sangha, we join a community of practitioners who support and guide us on the path.
