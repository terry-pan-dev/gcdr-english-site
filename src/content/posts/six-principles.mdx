The Six Principles established by Venerable Master Hsuan Hua serve as ethical guidelines for practitioners at all Dharma Realm Buddhist Association (DRBA) monasteries, including the Gold Coast Dharma Realm. These principles are not mere rules, but rather expressions of wisdom that, when practiced, lead to personal transformation and benefit for all.

## The Six Principles

### 1. No Fighting

This principle goes beyond physical conflict to address the mental habits of competition, comparison, and contention. When we stop fighting, we create space for cooperation and harmony.

  Fighting arises from attachment to self. When we see through the illusion of a separate self, the urge to fight naturally subsides.

### 2. No Greed

Greed is the endless hunger that is never satisfied. By letting go of greed, we discover that true contentment comes not from acquiring more, but from wanting less.

### 3. No Seeking

Constant seeking keeps us in a state of dissatisfaction. This principle invites us to appreciate what we have and to recognize that what we truly seek is already present within us.

### 4. No Selfishness

Selfishness narrows our world to the concerns of a single being. Letting go of selfishness expands our hearts to embrace all beings with equal care.

  If you are selfish, you will never attain true happiness. Only through forgetting the self can genuine joy be found.
</Quote>

### 5. No Pursuing Personal Advantage

This principle encourages us to act for the benefit of all rather than seeking personal gain. When we stop pursuing our own advantage, we naturally contribute to the welfare of the community.

### 6. No Lying

Truthfulness is the foundation of trust. When we commit to honesty in all our words, we create an environment where genuine communication and spiritual progress become possible.

## Living the Principles

These six principles are interconnected. Fighting often arises from greed; seeking comes from selfishness; lying serves the pursuit of personal advantage. When we work on any one principle, we naturally support our practice of all the others.

## A Daily Practice

Each morning, we can reflect on these principles and set an intention to embody them throughout the day. Each evening, we can review our actions and note where we succeeded and where we fell short, without judgment.

The goal is not perfection, but continual improvement. With patience and persistence, these principles gradually become second nature, transforming not only ourselves but also our relationships and communities.
