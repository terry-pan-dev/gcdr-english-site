Nestled in the serene landscape of the Gold Coast hinterland, the Gold Coast Dharma Realm offers a sanctuary where visitors can experience the timeless rhythms of Buddhist temple life. Each day unfolds according to a schedule that has remained essentially unchanged for centuries, yet feels remarkably relevant to our modern search for meaning and peace.

## The Morning Bell

At 4:00 AM, the temple bell resonates through the darkness, calling residents and guests to morning practice. This early rising is not merely tradition; it represents our commitment to awakening in both the literal and spiritual sense.

  Visitors are welcome to join morning practice. While 4 AM may seem early, many find that this quiet hour, before the world awakens, offers the most profound opportunity for meditation.

| Time | Activity |

| 4:00 AM | Morning bell & meditation |
| 5:00 AM | Morning ceremony |

## Work as Practice

In the Buddhist tradition, work is not separate from spiritual practice. Whether sweeping the courtyard, preparing meals, or tending the gardens, each task becomes an opportunity for mindfulness and service.
