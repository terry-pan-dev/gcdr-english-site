Mindfulness is not just something we practice on the cushion—it is a way of being that can infuse every moment of our lives with presence and awareness.

<Callout type="insight">
  When we are mindful, even ordinary activities become sacred. Washing dishes, walking to work, or eating a meal can all become opportunities for awakening.
</Callout>

## Morning Mindfulness

The way we begin our day sets the tone for everything that follows. Before reaching for your phone or rushing into activity:

1. **Take three conscious breaths** as you first wake
2. **Set an intention** for how you want to show up today
3. **Express gratitude** for another day of life

## Mindful Eating

<Quote author="Thich Nhat Hanh">
  When we eat mindfully, we are not just nourishing our body, but also our mind and spirit.
</Quote>

Transform your meals into meditation:

- Put away all devices
- Notice the colors and textures of your food
- Chew slowly and taste fully
- Recognize all the causes and conditions that brought this food to you

## Evening Reflection

Before sleep, take a few minutes to:

- Review the day without judgment
- Acknowledge moments of mindfulness
- Let go of any tension or worry
- Rest in gratitude

The practice continues, moment by moment, breath by breath.
