This is a sample blog post created to demonstrate what a blog card looks like when it doesn't contain an image.

When a blog post doesn't have an image specified in the frontmatter, the BlogCard component will automatically display a beautiful placeholder with:

- A decorative dark background with dot pattern
- A Dharma wheel icon in the center
- The category name displayed below the icon

## Key Features

The placeholder design maintains visual consistency with the rest of the blog while clearly indicating that no image is provided for this particular post.

<Callout type="insight">
  This placeholder ensures that all blog cards have consistent sizing and visual
  weight, even when images are not available.
</Callout>

## Visual Design

The placeholder uses the same color scheme as the rest of the site:

- Background: Dark (#1c1917) with subtle dot pattern
- Accent color: Gold (#c9a050) for the Dharma wheel and category text
- Elegant and minimal design that fits the aesthetic

You can use this sample to see exactly how your blog cards will appear when no image is provided.
